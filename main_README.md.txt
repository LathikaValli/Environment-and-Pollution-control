# Environmental Monitoring Project – Underwater Plastic Pollution

This repository contains all codes and results for my internship project on analyzing and detecting underwater plastic pollution.

## Folder Structure

- **Week1_Preprocessing/**  
  Contains data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing Jupyter notebook and its README.

- **Week2_Training_Testing/**  
  Contains the model training and testing notebook, code for running YOLOv8, and results/outputs with a README.

- **archive/**  
  Includes the dataset split into images, labels, and data.yaml configuration.

- **runs/**  
  Output folder generated by YOLOv8 training with saved model weights and results.

- **yolov8n.pt**  
  The YOLOv8 Nano model weights used for transfer learning.

## How to Use

1. Review Week 1’s notebook for preprocessing steps.
2. In Week 2’s notebook, follow the instructions to train and test the YOLOv8 model.
3. Results and best model weights will be found inside the `runs/detect/` folder after training.

All folders include their own README.md for more details.
